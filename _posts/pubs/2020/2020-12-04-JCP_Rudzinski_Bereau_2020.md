abstract: 'Coarse-grained (CG) conformational surface hopping (SH) adapts the concept of multisurface dynamics, initially developed to describe electronic transitions in chemical reactions, to accurately describe classical molecular dynamics at a reduced level. The SH scheme couples distinct conformational basins (states), each described by its own force field (surface), resulting in a significant improvement of the approximation to the many-body potential ofmean force [T. Bereau and J. F. Rudzinski, <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> 121, 256002 (2018)]. The present study first describes CG SH in more detail, through both a toy model and a three-bead model of hexane. We further extend the methodology to nonbonded interactions and report its impact on liquid properties. Finally, we investigate the transferability of the surfaces to distinct systems and thermodynamic state points, through a simple tuning of the state probabilities. In particular, applications to variations in temperature and chemical composition show good agreement with reference atomistic calculations, introducing a promising "weak-transferability regime," where CG force fields can be shared across thermodynamic and chemical neighborhoods.'
